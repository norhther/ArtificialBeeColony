# ABCOptimizer
The `ABCOptimizer` class implements the Artificial Bee Colony  optimization algorithm for solving optimization problems. It simulates the foraging behavior of honeybee swarms to explore and exploit solution spaces.

## Examples
The provided example minimizes the Sphere function, a common benchmark problem. Replace the `fitness_function` with your own objective function to customize.
